# GridWorld
enable the robot agent to learn optimal policies for navigating through the grid to reach the goal by implementing Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and reinforcement learning

Assume there is a grid world where a robot agent moves through a maze to find a goal. The world contains walls, traps, and gold. The robot gets rewards for collecting gold and penalties for
stepping on traps. It also gets a penalty (living reward) for each step it takes to encourage finding the optimal path.
